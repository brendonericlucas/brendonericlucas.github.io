I am a developer living and working in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. I have master's degrees in mathematics (Rhode Island College), machine learning (Georgia Insitute of Technology), and data science (The University of Texas at Austin). 

I have worked as an instructional associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a data specialist at Providence Public Schools, and a data engineer at CVS Health. 

I have extensive experience with database technologies and with data warehouse environments. 

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my spouse and our two cats, participating in book clubs with friends, reading and talking about philosophy, and playing guitar and writing music. I also enjoy working on personal / hoby projects like this website.

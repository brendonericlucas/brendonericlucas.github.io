I am a developer living and working in [Providence, Rhode Island, USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island). I have master's degrees in mathematics ([Rhode Island College](https://www.ric.edu/)), machine learning ([Georgia Insitute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)), and data science ([The University of Texas at Austin](https://admissions.utexas.edu/)). As of January 2024, I will be a full-time graduate student in the Physics Department at [The University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/physics/quantum/) pursuing my M.S. in Quantum Computing. I expect to complete my degree in the next 12 - 18 months, after which time I hope to return to work in industry. 

I have worked as an instructional associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a data specialist at [Providence Public Schools](https://www.providenceschools.org/), and a data engineer at [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/). 

I have extensive experience with database technologies and with a breadth of modern data warehousing environments. 

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my spouse and our two cats, participating in book clubs with friends, reading and talking about philosophy, and playing guitar and writing music. I also enjoy working on personal / hoby projects like this website. 

I consider myself a [Rawlsian Liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls), though friends and family who have studied more political philosophy than me typically tell me that I am probably actually just another [democratic socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism). 

**About the Name of My Webiste:** [_The Dirac Sea_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_sea) is the name given to a theoretical construct dreamt up by the physicist [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac) in the 1930s in order to account for negative energy solutions to the Dirac equation that Dirac discovered when applying the equation bearing his name to the electron. It is envisioned as an actually infinite sea of electrons all of which possess negative energy. Holes in the Dirac sea would eventually come to be indentified as positrons. The picture painted by the Dirac sea is often reagarded as unphysical or even misleading (but see [R. Jackiw](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9903255)), but it has always struck me as an exceptionally bold and daring posit and a testament to the power and potency of human imagination and its unreasonable effectiveness as a tool for understanding the strange nature of physical reality. Dirac was surely one of the most brilliant physicists of his - or any - age; Not only a first rate mathematician and theorist, but also a beautiful and eloquent writer. His treatise on quantum mechanics - written almost a century ago - is still one of the most readable and approachable texts on the subject.
